Documents in Git / A small server for documents generated by Software projects 

Continuous integration results in a increased number of builds for software projects;
this builds usually generate a variaty of artefacts including documentations.
Managing and maintaining access to different version of documentation is challenging and generates a lot of cognitive noise.
This is an attempt to eliminate that overhead by using git as storage mechanism and a minimal Snap server to allow access to it.
